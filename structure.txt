The above link is for all personnel and roster changes that have happened in the NBA within
the last seven days. This includes D-League recalls, suspensions, free agency signings, trades,
firings, hirings and fines. You can go back seven days at a time and the URL for previous weeks looks
something like this: http://espn.go.com/nba/transactions/_/date/20160202 the final number is 
a date for the first day of that week. This information is useful because these roster and
personnel moves can have a wide range of consequences for the team(s) involved which would be
kind of important to know if you are covering the league or a particular team as a beat writer.
Right now, the information is presented only based on date, with no option to sort it in any
other way. It would be cool to see this information presented in an excel table where you could
sort the transactions by player, type of transaction, or even by team but in a way where you
could get more of a side by side comparison with other teams.
